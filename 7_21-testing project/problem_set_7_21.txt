2- Generating better tracks for the ego_car in tracking. (Frenet tracking)
3- ego_car < self_car speed is essential.

State Feedback tracking


Problems:(Practical code from Professor)
R1-P:
1-  Only can up to 70 km(Out of bound chase)
2-  Only 1 round chase.
3-  No switching lane 

Solutions:
1- 
Step1:
Step 1-1:In cycle we have (Reading in x1,y1 location and x2, y2 location into formula.)
 
Step 1-2: Finding Curvatives in Monza map by scanning through all the points and calculating the formula,
reading from the map(Road_Center Column 1,2) and save it into Road_Center Column 3 variables.

Step2: Reading from the Road_Center and adjust into speed(finding max_speed) - Can be written inside Radar Generator

Step3: Adjust car_speed inside the "RadarGenerator.
